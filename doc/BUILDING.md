# Building/Compiling libdiscord

libdiscord uses the CMake build system, so building and installing should be fairly straightforward and relatively 
portable.

Dependencies: 
* libwebsockets 
    * minimum required version is v2.4, anything below that will not work
* jansson (used package bundled with ubuntu, version 2.9 or later should work, v2.7 has been confirmed to NOT work
(json_pack changed behavior))
* libcurl (used package bundled with ubuntu 17.10, any recent version should work)

Note that each dependency has their own dependencies, except for jansson. 

Tested to build and work on Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi W running Raspbian (stretch), 
but note that if you want to install libwebsockets with checkinstall on Raspbian, 
then you will have to compile checkinstall yourself. Otherwise, install with ``sudo make install``

Works on sparc64 debian 4.13.4-1 with no issues.

Works on macOS 10.14 "Mojave" after dependencies are properly installed.

### Quick build instructions for libwebsockets

Make sure you have the dependencies for libwebsockets installed.

Get a copy of libwebsockets source from github.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets 
```
Checkout the right version (2.4.1)
```bash
cd libwebsockets
git checkout v2.4.1
```
Create a seperate build directory
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
Build it
```bash
cmake ..
make
```
Install the library (option 1, preferred). Make sure you read the prompts that come up regarding expluding certain files.
```bash
sudo checkinstall --pkgname libwebsockets-sdev --pkgversion="2.4.1"
```
Note that you can uninstall libwebsockets afterward using apt or dpkg 
if you install libwebsockets with checkinstall, in case something breaks

Install the library (option 2) if you don't have/can't get checkinstall
```bash
sudo make install
```
Update shared library cache so libwebsockets gets linked when we run our bot.
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```
